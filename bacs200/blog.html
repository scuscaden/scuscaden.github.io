                    <h2>Polarization</h2>
                    <p>Polarization is the movement of ideals away from the center to the extremes on the political spectrum. This phenominon has been going on sice the 90's, fueled 
                    by attack advertisement and social media.  This  has created an attitude of hatred towards the other side which is much more effective at bringing people to the 
                    polls than admiration of your own candidate.  The rhetoric is no longer about how my candidate can improve this country, but rather how the opposing candidate will 
                    ruin this country.  Voting on fear is ruining the relationships Americans have with each other, there is no open floor for discussion, just emotionally charged rants 
                    on social media and violence in the streets.  Voters are following their polititians on all issues rather than chosing the issues that mean the most to them.  This chart
                    shows political leanings for Republicans and Democats when asked a series of questions about their beliefs and where they lie on a two-dementional political compass.  we
                    are increasingly moving to the very edges of the political spectrum and it shows in our social interactions.

                    <h2>The Solution</h2>
                    <p>If we want to see real change in this country we need to narrow this gap.  The polititians were the ones that created this polarization to increase voter turnout
                    and funding, we can't let the externality of that be resentment of the other side.  Politics are not black or white, Republican or Democrat, there is a lot of gray areas.
                    Beleifs shouldn't follow the party line because issues are complex and constantly changing.  You don't have to be a Republican if you are pro-life and you don't have to be 
                    a Democrat if you support universal healthcare.  We as a nation need to start putting emotions on the sidlines and decide what is really important to us and our country.</p>
