        What makes a hero? A hero is someone that we look up to.
        Heroes embody what we truly value most. Therefore who we select as
        role models says a lot about who we are as people.
    </p>
    <p>
        The heroes that I most admire have the following characteristics.
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>Insane Work Ethic - they are always working to better themselves</li>
        <li>Motivate others - people look up to people who are genuine</li>
        <li>True to Themselves - No one is perfect, but accepting our flaws and working to improve on them shows character</li>
        <li>Sacrifice & Commitment - their goals are more important than their comfort</li>
        <li>Integrity - they live true to their calling</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
        Kevin Heart is commited to making himself better every day.  He is the epitome of you get out what you put in, and he puts in everything. everyday.  This work ethic is what enspires me to put in that extra hour of studing, or to workout that extra 30 minutes just because you can.  He knows that you can always give a little bit more, he wears a dozen different hats.  He is a comedian, a movie star, an entrapanuer, head of a movie studio, he's got his own podcast, and he still finds time to spend with his family and to go to the gym.  This kind of work ethic is an insperation.
